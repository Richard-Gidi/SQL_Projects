# Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. 
# Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements 
# That might look like their own SQL.
